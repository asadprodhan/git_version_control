## What is Git Version Control


Git Version Control is a system that can track changes in a document. Like the track change option in a microsoft word document. However, the Git Version Control and the Microsoft Track Change are different in their scopes, functionality, and purposes. See the comparision below:


<br />


| **Aspect**              | **Git Version Control**                                                                                      | **Microsoft Word Track Changes**                                                                |
|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose and Scope**    | Tracks changes in code and project files across an entire repository.                                        | Tracks changes in a single text document (e.g., edits, comments, formatting).                  |
| **Granularity**          | Tracks changes at the **line-level** across multiple files.                                                 | Tracks changes at the **character or word-level** in a single document.                        |
| **Collaboration**        | Supports distributed collaboration with each user having a local copy of the repository.                    | Centralized editing; changes are visible within the shared document or during real-time edits. |
| **Version History**      | Maintains a detailed history of all commits and allows reversion to any previous state.                     | Limited versioning tied to the document; relies on manual saves or cloud services for history. |
| **File Types**           | Works with any file type, especially text-based files like code or configuration files.                     | Limited to `.docx` or compatible Word formats.                                                 |
| **Conflict Resolution**  | Resolves merge conflicts programmatically or manually during file merges.                                   | Highlights conflicts inline for manual resolution by users.                                    |
| **Branching and Merging**| Supports branching for parallel development and merging for integration of changes.                        | Does not support branching; all edits are applied directly to the document.                   |
| **Offline Usage**        | Fully functional offline; all repositories are local copies.                                                | Requires the document and Track Changes settings to be available locally.                     |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Best for software development, managing large codebases, and collaborative coding projects.                 | Best for collaborative text document editing, such as writing and reviewing reports.           |

## **How to use the Git Version Control in Windows computer**


## Requirements

- `Download Visual Studio Code


- Create a GitHub account


- Create a GitHub repository and name it git_version_control (for example) 


## **Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code**

See an example below:

</p>

</p>


## Step 1


- Set GitBash in the terminal


- Create a directory in your local computer


- Initiate a GitHub repository


```
git init
```


```
mkdir git_version_control
```

- Create a README file


```
touch README.md
```


## Step 2


- Open the git_version_control directory that you have created in Step 1


## Step 3


- Open the README.md file by clicking on it


## Step 4


- Start writing your README doc and save by using ctrl-S


## Step 5


- Open a preview panel for your README markdown document


## Step 6


- Connect your local GitHub repo (git_version_control) to your online GitHub repo (git_version_control)


```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/asadprodhan/git_version_control.git
```


- Check the status of your files


```
git status
```


- Stage the changes


```
git add .
```


- Commit the changes with a message


```
git commit -m "message"
```


- Push the changes to your online GitHub repository


```
git push -u origin main
```



# FAQ


## How to upload images from local computer to the GitHub repository?


- Add a specific image


```
git add <image_file_name>
```

- Or add all changes

```
git add .
```

- Stage the changes

```
git commit -m "message"
```


- Push the changes to the online GitHub repository


```
git push -u origin main
```


## How to display the image in README document 


- Collect the image path from your GitHub repository by righ-clicking on the image and copying the link


- Add the following add chunk to your README document


<br />

```
<p align="center">
  <img 
    src="https://github.com/asadprodhan/git_version_control/blob/main/vs_code_annot.PNG"
 align="center" width=100% height=100% >

# Generated SSH key for GitHub

# The codes to generate a ssh key:

ssh -T git@github.com
git config --global user.name "Asad Prodhan"

Paste this key to the GitHub new shh key section and authenticate


# Let's create a git repo

mkdir gitgood
cd gitgood

# Let's initiate the repo
git init
If it works, you see the following mesage
Initialized empty Git repository in /data/workshop_git/gitgood/.git/

Once we have run git init on a directory, there is no need to run it again in subdirectories of the original directory. Thatâ€™s why we should run the command on the parent directory of the project, and we can include additional subdirectories as needed.

git init initializes a repository.
Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory.

# This doesn't show anything
ls

# This shows the following
ls -a
. .. .git 
. is the current directory
.. one directory before

# We can now try one of the most important Git commands, which tells us the current state of our repository:
git status
Output:
On branch master
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

# Let's create documents within the repo
touch README.md

nano README.md

Or
Open the folder in VS Code and then open the README.md file and write

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch
master

git branch -M main
master renamed to main

Create a repo in GitHub but don't include a README.md file in there

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/asadprodhan/git_version_control.git
Authenticate
git remote -v
git push -u origin main

Keep writing the README.md file in VSCode
and 
git add README.md

git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin main
