## What is Git Version Control


Git Version Control is a system that can track changes in a document. Like the track change option in a microsoft word document. However, the Git Version Control and the Microsoft Track Change are different in their scopes, functionality, and purposes. See the comparision below:


| **Aspect**              | **Git Version Control**                                                                                      | **Microsoft Word Track Changes**                                                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose and Scope**    | Tracks changes in code and project files across an entire repository.                                        | Tracks changes in a single text document (e.g., edits, comments, formatting).                  |
| **Granularity**          | Tracks changes at the **line-level** across multiple files.                                                 | Tracks changes at the **character or word-level** in a single document.                        |
| **Collaboration**        | Supports distributed collaboration with each user having a local copy of the repository.                    | Centralized editing; changes are visible within the shared document or during real-time edits. |
| **Version History**      | Maintains a detailed history of all commits and allows reversion to any previous state.                     | Limited versioning tied to the document; relies on manual saves or cloud services for history. |
| **File Types**           | Works with any file type, especially text-based files like code or configuration files.                     | Limited to `.docx` or compatible Word formats.                                                 |
| **Conflict Resolution**  | Resolves merge conflicts programmatically or manually during file merges.                                   | Highlights conflicts inline for manual resolution by users.                                    |
| **Branching and Merging**| Supports branching for parallel development and merging for integration of changes.                        | Does not support branching; all edits are applied directly to the document.                   |
| **Offline Usage**        | Fully functional offline; all repositories are local copies.                                                | Requires the document and Track Changes settings to be available locally.                     |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Best for software development, managing large codebases, and collaborative coding projects.                 | Best for collaborative text document editing, such as writing and reviewing reports.           |



## **How to use the Git Version Control**



## Windows Users


## **Step 1: What does data visualisation do?**

# Checking existing ssh key
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys 

git config --global user.name "Asad Prodhan"
git config --global user.email "prodhan82@email.com"

# Generated SSH key for GitHub

# The codes to generate a ssh key:

ssh -T git@github.com
git config --global user.name "Asad Prodhan"
git config --global user.email "prodhan82@email.com"
ssh -T git@github.com
git --version
ssh -T git@github.com
ls .ssh
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-keygen
ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub



ssh-rsa XXXXX

Paste this key to the GitHub new shh key section and authenticate


# Let's create a git repo

mkdir gitgood
cd gitgood

# Let's initiate the repo
git init
If it works, you see the following mesage
Initialized empty Git repository in /data/workshop_git/gitgood/.git/

Once we have run git init on a directory, there is no need to run it again in subdirectories of the original directory. Thatâ€™s why we should run the command on the parent directory of the project, and we can include additional subdirectories as needed.

git init initializes a repository.
Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory.

# This doesn't show anything
ls

# This shows the following
ls -a
. .. .git 
. is the current directory
.. one directory before

# We can now try one of the most important Git commands, which tells us the current state of our repository:
git status
Output:
On branch master
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

# Let's create documents within the repo
touch README.md

nano README.md

Or
Open the folder in VS Code and then open the README.md file and write

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch
master

git branch -M main
master renamed to main

Create a repo in GitHub but don't include a README.md file in there

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/asadprodhan/git_version_control.git
Authenticate
git remote -v
git push -u origin main

Keep writing the README.md file in VSCode
and 
git add README.md

git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin main
